cp -avr fabric-sample/fabric-samples/ .

These commands worked for me:

	$ dockerd

	$ dockerd &

This runs dockerd deamon as a background process (more useful)
These commands didn't work for me:

	$ sudo service start docker or $ sudo service restart docker

	$ sudo systemctl start docker
	
cp -avr temp_work/fabric-samples/ home/fabric/
